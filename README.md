# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines: incorrect use of the `$unwind` operator. The bug involves performing a `$lookup` to join collections and then using `$unwind` to process the resulting array.  Improper use can lead to unexpected data duplication or aggregation failures.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue is described in more detail in the respective files.  This is a common issue for developers unfamiliar with the intricacies of MongoDB's aggregation framework.

## How to reproduce the bug
1.  Ensure you have MongoDB installed and running.
2.  Create the `users` and `products` collections with appropriate data.
3.  Execute the code in `bug.js`.
4. Observe the unexpected results due to incorrect `$unwind` usage. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected aggregation pipeline, using `$unwind` correctly to avoid data duplication.
